						<p>Spice Fuzion's innovative concept seeks to provide a diverse spice selection for health benefits. Its goal is to create rich yet healthy flavors through spices, such as turmeric and coriander leaves, in food and drinks that people consume often, such as fries, corn, pizza, and beer.</p>

						<p class="removebottom">The minds behind this idea wish to have a simple, clear, and straightforward e-commerce website for their target audience, restaurants and breweries. I was initially given a preliminary web design to redesign. In specific, the client asked for the spices' health benefits to be educational and highly visible as a marketing strategy. In addition, the product page should contain useful information and accompanied by different recipes to spark creative possibilities.</p>

				<h2>user flow</h2>
				<p class="addtop">Following the research process, I returned to the original web design and redesigned it according to the results. These are the set of screens that are the most important elements to the customer's experience as they browse through the site.</p>

				<h2>style guide</h2>
				<p class="addtop">To create a contrast and establish a clear hierarchy of the website, I used the combination of sans serif and serif. For headlines, big texts, and navigations, sans serif Montserrat's clean and neutral style stands out as focal points. Garamond, on the other hand, is the serif typeface for the body text because of its legibility and familiarity. The main color is black to create simplicity and clarity with a navy accent from the logo.</p>
