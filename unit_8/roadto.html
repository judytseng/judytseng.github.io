						<p>Road To is a unique concept created and developed by a 9 year old, from his unsatisfying experience of finding project ideas online. Ajay wants to provide students of all ages a platform for researching and showcasing their projects. His goal is to build it as organized, safe and intuitive as possible with kid-friendly ads.</p>

						<p>The platform must attract and cater to the needs of different target audience: elementary, middle, and high school students as well as parents and teachers. As a result, the layouts and features are slightly different. Moreover, the platform allows students to explore different careers at a young age and to build connections with professionals in the interested fields. Eventually, the platform will be valuable and imperative to a student's educational and professional success.</p>

						<p class="removebottom">*Due to confidentiality concerns, only partial screens are shown here to present the general design concept. To view more screens, please contact me directly.</p>

				<h2>competitive analysis</h2>
				<p class="addtop">To start the process, I began researching other project sharing websites and analyzing various factors such as the navigation, content, security and graphics. In addition, I studied any differential features to understand the additional value and beneficial experience it provides to students.</p>

				<h2>rough screens</h2>
				<p class="addtop">After analyzing the plus/delta model for existing competitors, I created a set of lo-fi wireframes that would be part of the user's journey through the platform. Although the interface will differ among users (student grade, parent, and teacher), the fundamental design and concept remain consistent and coherent in each layout.</p>

				<h2>style guide</h2>
				<p class="addtop">Since our target audience are students of all ages, our color scheme is plain and easy to understand. The dominant color is black with red for call-to-action buttons and yellow to match the logo. The sans serif Montserrat font style is simple and clean with a nice x-height, appropriate for young and older children. Users can also select from various color themes to customize their profile page. These colors are warmer and softer version of the primary colors: red, green and blue.</p>
